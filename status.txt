Revamped everything and all good to go. Sent out a tweetorial today. Should push to CRAN.



May 1, 2019

Version on CRAN is 3.1.2, from 2016. Version on GitHub is 4.1.1. Looks like I
updated a lot of the functions but then sort of stopped. Need to add tabmeans_svy,
tabmedians_svy, tabfreq_svy, and tabmulti_svy. Can decide whether to paste in
from old version (rforge_9_8_14 folder) or revamp.

Currently, pasted in tabmeans_svy and started to fill out documentation. Need to
finish and do same for similar functions.

Also want to decide where to put function called regtable in tab and clean_glm
in dvmisc. Maybe make clean_glm, clean_gee, etc.? Seems like it belongs in tab,
though. Could also do clean_lme etc.
