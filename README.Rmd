```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>", 
  message = FALSE
)

# Load packages
library("tab")
library("knitr")
library("gee")

# Set xtable options
options("xtable.caption.placement" = "top", 
        "xtable.include.rownames" = TRUE, 
        "xtable.comment" = FALSE)
```

## Installation

You can install and load **tab** from GitHub via the following code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("vandomed/tab")
library("tab")
```

## Functions

The main purpose of **tab** is to create neatly formatted summary tables for papers and presentations. The following functions are included:

* `glm_v` Print a GLM summary table to the RStudio Viewer.
* `tabglm` summarizes generalized linear models (GLM's) fit via `glm` or `survey::svyglm`. 
* `tabgee` summarizes generalized estimating equation models (GEE's) fit via `gee::gee`. 
* `tabcoxph` summarizes Cox Proportional Hazards models fit via `survival::coxph` or `survey::svycoxph`.
* `tabmulti` compares variables across two or more groups, e.g. to create a "Table 1."
* `tabmulti.svy` does the same thing as `tabmulti` but for complex survey data.


## Regression summaries with 2 extra keystrokes

### GLM's

To summarize a fitted generalized linear model, simply call `glm_v` as you would `glm`. The result will be a formatted summary table printed to the RStudio Viewer.

#### Linear regression

Here's a linear regression of BMI on age, sex, and race. Once you call `glm_v`, a summary table will pop up in the RStudio Viewer.

```{r eval = FALSE}
glm_v(BMI ~ Age + Sex + Race, data = tabdata)
```

From here, you can "snip" the summary table and save it as a figure (as I did for this README) or copy directly from the Viewer and paste outside of R.

#### Logistic regression

Of course `glm` supports all sorts of regression models, and `glm_v` should play nice at least with the more common ones. Here's a logistic regression for 1-year mortality vs. age, BMI, and sex, with some higher-order terms:

```{r eval = FALSE}
glm_v(death_1yr ~ poly(Age, 2, raw = TRUE) + Sex * BMI, data = tabdata, family = binomial)
```

<!-- ## Exporting tables, e.g. to Word -->

<!-- All of the functions in **tab** have an argument called `print.html` which can  -->
<!-- be used to export tables to word processors. Setting `print.html = TRUE` will  -->
<!-- result in a HTML table being output to your current working directory. You can  -->
<!-- open the table (e.g. in Chrome) and copy/paste into your report. -->


<!-- ## Options for printing in R -->

<!-- I used **knitr**'s `kable` function for the examples here, but other approaches  -->
<!-- should also work (e.g. **xtable**'s `xtable` or **pandoc**'s `pandoc.table`). -->
